In Reasonable Faith, William Lane Craig takes the reader on a broad tour of Christian apologetics and apologetic thought as it has evolved throughout history. Starting with an appeal to the absurdity of life without God and ending with a defense of miracles, Craig samples from both offensive and defensive apologetics--providing arguments for Christian truth and defending against criticism. This book presents itself as a scholarly source of apologetic information, with its dense chapters lending itself well to study in a classroom setting or for intense personal study. Craig makes it clear through the narrative that he is not one to shy away from any credible detail of science when defending or exploring Christian thought.

My hope for this book was a thorough introduction to apologetics, as I had never read a book on apologetics before. I believe that part of my personal journey with God brought me to this book. Specifically, when I first considered placing my trust in Christ, I faced what I like to call an "intellectual barrier". Some Christians will tell you that the gospel never needs any intellectual considerations. I disagree, but in some vein, I can understand where they are coming from. Intellectual consideration of Christian truth isn't a prerequisite for being saved. The bible tells us that we are saved through the Holy Spirit and by the grace of God:

> Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God and God in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us.
>
> -- 1 John 3:24

Clearly, there is no necessity for academic scrutiny of Christianity required here. However, to say that it never needs any intellectual consideration is, in my opinion, a bit strong. Who says the Holy Spirit can't work through intellectual and academic exploration of doctrine? Anyway, the "intellectual barrier" I mentioned earlier was a barrier for me coming to faith that was caused by my own logical scrutiny of the claims of Christianity. For me, the result of this scrutiny at the time was that I concluded that Christianity was probably not true. A simple example of my thought concerns the story of creation--How can the story of creation be true when I know of the Big Bang? How could God have created the world if there is so much evidence for the Big Bang? There were many more questions like this and I felt as if I wasn't giving myself intellectual permission to believe in God--hence the phrase "intellectual barrier". What confused me more was that despite this holding me back, I felt very convicted at both large group and church. God was working in me, but I believe that a book as comprehensive and well thought out as Reasonable Faith would have helped me immensely during that time. And naturally, I was motivated to read Reasonable Faith with the hope that I would later help someone else in my same position.

There is a lot to like about Reasonable Faith. For one, Craig's arguments for the existence of God and the trustworthiness of the bibles strike a good balance between being complex enough to refute most attacks on the argument as well as being simple enough to explain to a layman. In instances where this balance seems impossible Craig errors on the side of complexity, giving the book its textbook-like feel. I also like Craig's temperament when discussing "why apologetics" and "the ultimate apologetic" at the beginning and end of his book respectively. Both topics involve a meta-discussion on apologetics, which he handles well to motivate the reader to learn apologetics and provide resolution at the end of the book. In his section on "why apologetics" Craig argues that apologetics is important to a certain extent. He argues that the general viability of the truth of Christianity on an intellectual level to potential believers is important--if my "intellectual barrier" wasn't convincing enough alone. this intellectual viability has been declining in Western culture due somewhat to a neglecting of apologetics. Craig concludes with a 3-page chapter titled "the ultimate apologetic" in which he takes a step back and reflects on what we learned. After being in the academic weeds for so long not only was this a breath of fresh air but Craig makes some powerful conclusions. I think that the best way to describe this section is to share two quotes that I think sum it up nicely:

> But now I want to share with you what I believe to be the most practical apologetic for the Christian faith that I know of. This apologetic will help you win more persons to Christ than all of the other arguments in your apologetic arsenal put together. This ultimate apologetic involves two relationships: your relationship with God and your relationship with others.

> More often than not it is who you *are* rather than what you *say* that will bring an unbeliever to Christ.

All in all, Reasonable Faith was a mostly enjoyable read for me, barring a few moments where I felt so lost in the complicated scientific explanations of quantum gravity and such that Craig provides. I would recommend this book to anyone with a strong apologetics interest who can stomach a heavy appeal to science. At almost 400 pages this book isn't for the faint of heart.
